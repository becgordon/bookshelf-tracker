        Shelf-Help is intended to help users track their physical book collection. It utilizes the Google Books API to search and store information about a user's books. It allows them to rate, categorize, and view statistics about their library. Users can view other users' libraries and add books to their own library from there. The site can offer up a book to read next from the user's To Be Read shelf and it offers the ability to share your current read.

        <div>
          Rebecca Gordon currently resides in beautiful Oregon. After receiving a BFA in Tech Theatre Production from Western Oregon University, they worked as a stage manager and properties designer. They were driven by finding solutions to problems in a collaborative environment and providing care for others in a management role. Later they would assist in the opening of a cafe before a role as an operations manager for a business specializing in astrologically-timed beauty products. While they have certainly had a wide range of work experiences, each one has been centered on creating an environment where folks always feel welcome and heard. They bring life experiences as an openly queer person and strive to bring more diversity to the tech world.        </div>
